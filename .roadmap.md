# Cafe Roadmap

## Milestones
- [x] MCP architecture scaffold complete
- [x] Composable pipeline system (modular forecasting components)
- [x] Protocol (API) endpoints for forecasting
- [x] Model integration: vLLM (local), Gemini (API), HuggingFace (local)
- [x] Context: in-memory, extensible to DB (in-memory complete, DB next)
- [x] News retrieval tools (Google News, modular, refactored)
- [x] Metaculus integration (fetching, caching, endpoints)
- [ ] Expand time-series models (statsmodels, Prophet, etc.)
- [ ] Production-grade context (DB-backed, multi-user)
- [ ] Advanced evaluation/experiment tracking
- [ ] Automated tests for all components
- [ ] Full CI/CD pipeline (deployment, coverage, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation and onboarding
- [ ] Demo polish and user-facing examples

## Project Setup
- Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating and managing the virtual environment and dependencies.
- All code is under the `cafe/` package, with categorized submodules:
  - `models/llm/`, `models/timeseries/` for forecasting models
  - `news/` - [x] News retrieval tools (cafe/news/) — Google News fetcher: modular, mypy-safe, compatible with free CSE, no file-based caching by default, `protocols/`, `utils/` for supporting layers

## Epics
- Protocol Layer: API, schemas, validation
- Model Layer: vLLM, Gemini, time-series
- Context Layer: state, storage, config

---
_This roadmap should be updated as the project evolves._
