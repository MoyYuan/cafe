# Cafe Roadmap

## Milestones
- [ ] MCP architecture scaffold complete
- [x] Composable pipeline system (modular forecasting components)
- [ ] Protocol (API) endpoints for forecasting
- [ ] Model integration: vLLM (local), Gemini (API), HuggingFace (local)
- [ ] Context: in-memory, extensible to DB
- [ ] Automated tests and CI/CD
- [ ] Documentation and onboarding

## Project Setup
- Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating and managing the virtual environment and dependencies.
- All code is under the `cafe/` package, with categorized submodules:
  - `models/llm/`, `models/timeseries/` for forecasting models
  - `news/` - [x] News retrieval tools (cafe/news/) â€” Google News fetcher: modular, mypy-safe, compatible with free CSE, no file-based caching by default, `protocols/`, `utils/` for supporting layers

## Epics
- Protocol Layer: API, schemas, validation
- Model Layer: vLLM, Gemini, time-series
- Context Layer: state, storage, config

_This roadmap should be updated as the project evolves._
